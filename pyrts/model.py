        PyRTS objects represent seismic tomography of the mantle

        The serise of tomographic models such as "S20RTS",
        "S40RTS", and "SP12RTS" represent seismic velocities using
        the same basic parameterisation, with a spherical harmonic
        basis used for lateral velocity variation and cubic splines
        used to describe model variation in radius. The models also
        share a common file format to store model parameters. PyRTS
        objects allow this class of models to be reperesented and
        manipulated in python.

        Objects can be created 'empty' by passing in an integer
        spherical harmonic degree, or can be populated from an ".sph"
        file. All known models use the same radial parameterisation,
        but alternititve spline knots and depths for the CMB and Moho
        can be provided using additional optional arguments.

        Arguments:
        filename: a path-like object representing a ".sph" file used
              to initialise this model. Normally this is a string (optional)
        degree: integer representing the maximum spherical harmonic
              degree of this model (optional unless filename is None).
        knots: cubic spline knots in the range [1, -1] representing the
              radial parameterisation. If not provided a default used
              for all known models is used (optional list of floats)
        inner_radius: radius of the inside of the model in km (optional)
        outer_radius: radius of the outside of the model in km (optional)
